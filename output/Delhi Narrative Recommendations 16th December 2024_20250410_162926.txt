Had Cong passed Lokpal Bill, AAP wouldn't have been formed: Delhi ex-CM
Brief
Speaking at the launch of a book, Kejriwal said, "The sole demand of the Anna movement was to pass the Lokpal Bill.
Had the Congress government passed the Bill, AAP would not have been formed.
They did not pass the Bill and challenged us to contest elections and pass the Bill.
This was the time we decided to form the party."
