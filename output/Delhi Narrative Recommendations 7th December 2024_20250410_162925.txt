Actionable
Meeting with ECI, Sandeep Dikshit, Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera
*
Highlight that grave allegations have been made by AAP in Delhi about the electoral process while the BJP has refuted & made even more problematic claims
*
In this ongoing war of words, the only victim is the public's trust in the ECI and the electoral process
*
Therefore, the ECI should intervene and order an impartial investigation into the claims
*
Demand that the investigation be conducted immediately & the findings released so as to restore public trust On-Ground, 9 Assemblies

Narrative
*
AAP ka MLA Fail Hai
*
AAP's new Party Model is made up of former Congress & BJP leaders Press Byte, Pawan Khera
*
Highlight that when AAP came to power, it claimed to be the party that was different from Congress & BJP
*
Now, their leaders both young & old are leaving politics, all they are doing is bringing on board old Congress & BJP leaders

*
There may be many reasons for this ○ AAP has finally realised that its MLAs have failed miserably to perform in 10 years ○ AAP is finally admitting their party's governance model is a failure & they need leaders from older parties to come & teach how to govern
*
What seems clear is, that by the time the final AAP candidate lists roll out, a majority of AAP's candidates will have been replaced to mislead the public into thinking they will have better representatives
*
But, the top leadership has not changed & nothing will have actually changed
