Nakaam Sarkar: Jo Kaha, Vo Kabhi Nahi Karenge
*
Ameer Aadmi Party is blind to the misery of the homeless Press Byte, Sandeep Dikshit
*
Highlight that every year, during extreme heat & cold conditions, AAP's homeless shelters have come under scrutiny for not even doing the bare minimum for the homeless ○ When it comes to Kejriwal's Sheesh Mahal or Raghav Chadha's Type VII bungalows they are quick to file appeals in courts ○ But when it comes to standing up against BJP's demolitions or providing shelter to the homeless, they utterly fail and become blind ○ Now also, AAP is blaming the LG for not being able to provide good governance to the people of Delhi
*
Ask if they are so incapable, why should Delhi give them another chance?
