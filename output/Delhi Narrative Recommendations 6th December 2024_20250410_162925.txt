'Told you not to ask ulta-seedha question': BBC interview with Avadh Ojha stopped at AAP office
Brief
The interview was stopped minutes after reporter Anshul Singh asked Ojha whether he will continue to praise the BJP and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the AAP's political rivals.
Ojha tried to answer but a voice in the background said, "I had told you not to ask any ulta-seedha (odd) question.
Stop this." Ojha then says, "Bhaiyya dekho, I will tell you.
The party will decide the line.
This is what these people will decide." He then removes his lapel mic.
