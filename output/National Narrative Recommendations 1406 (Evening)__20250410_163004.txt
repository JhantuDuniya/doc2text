A delegation of all parties should visit Manipur to find resolution to stop the on-going violence.

India has been hacked, but the Modi government does not want to take responsibility 
Ashwini Vaishnaw is an incompetent and irresponsible Minister. 
Will the BJP govt hold the right people accountable for the privacy leak? 
Who is Ashwini Vaishnaw selling the data to? 

Press conference, Shashi Tharoor
Demand that Ashwini Vaishnaw take responsibility for the CoWin data leak. 
He should say that the BJP has neither taken responsibility for the Balasore Train Tragedy or the CoWin data leak
He should ask: 'Where is Ashwani Vaishnav hiding?' 
Highlight that after the Balasore Train Tragedy, the government went after low-hanging fruit like the station master, instead of sacking the minister. 
Chidambaram should reiterate that the BJP had trusted an incompetent person, like Ashwini Vaishnaw, who is a mere 'yes man' with crucial ministries, which has resulted in the Balasore Train Tragedy, and the CoWin data leak. 

Party, Legal Action 
INC Legal Cell, in coordination with NGOs such as the Internet Freedom Foundation should file a PIL to ensure a legal regime is in place to protect data in the hands of the government

Actionable | Narrative Stance 
The Modi government is exerting pressure on bank officials and preventing them from taking action against Nirav Modi, because of his connection to the PM 
The Modi government allowed Nirav Modi to flee the country 
Both N Modis are in cahoots and have a singular mission to loot the country 

Social media
