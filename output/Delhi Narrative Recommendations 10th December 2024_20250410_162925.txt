The Aam Aadmi Party has changed nearly 50 per cent of its sitting MLAs in the list of 31 candidates announced so far.
Former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has now been fielded from Jangpura, instead of Patparganj which he won in 2013, 2015 and
2020.
The party has fielded educator Avadh Ojha from the constituency.
