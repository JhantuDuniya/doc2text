Express report on Tuberculosis drug shortage: Delhi Health dept forms panel to look into supply gaps
Brief
The Delhi government Tuesday formed a committee to look into gaps in the supply of tuberculosis medicines in the city.
This comes after The Indian Express on December 17 reported on the non-availability of TB medicine to a 16-year-old patient named Harshita Singh Chandel; she filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court on the erratic supply from the district dispensary and the hospital.
The court directed the state government to provide her with medication.
